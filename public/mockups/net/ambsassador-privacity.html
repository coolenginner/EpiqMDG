            <h5>Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices</h5>
            <p>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED, AND DISCLOSED, AND HOW YOU CAN GET
                ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY AND REPORT ANY ISSUES, OR CONCERNS, TO EPIQ MD,
                INC.
                AT <a>7950 Legacy Drive, Suite 400, Plano, TX 75024</a></p>
            <p>The Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal program requiring that
                all
                medical records and other individually identifiable health information used, or disclosed, by us in any
                form, whether electronically, on paper, or orally, are kept properly confidential. This Act gives you,
                the
                Patient, significant new rights to understand and control how your health information is used. HIPAA
                provides penalties for covered entities that misuse personal health information.</p>
            <p>We have prepared this “Notice of HIPAA Privacy Practices” to explain how we as a Business Associate of
                the
                telemedicine provider are required to maintain the privacy of your health information and how we may use
                and
                disclose your health information.
                We may use and disclose your medical records for each of the following purposes: treatment, payment, and
                health care operations:
            </p>
            <p>TREATMENT means providing, coordinating, or managing health care and related services by one or more
                health
                care providers.</p>
            <p>PAYMENT means such activities as obtaining payment or reimbursement for services, billing or collection
                activities and utilization review. HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS include managing your Electronic Medical
                Record to
                facilitate diagnostic medical consultations with associated physicians, as well as conducting quality
                assessment review and service improvement planning activities, auditing functions, cost-containment
                analysis, and customer service.<br>We may also create and distribute de-identified health information by
                removing all references to individually identifiable information.</p>
            <p>We may contact you to provide information about our services or other health-related services that may be
                of
                interest to you.</p>
            <p>Any other uses and disclosures will be made only with your written authorization. You may revoke such
                authorization in writing and we are required to honor and abide by that written request, except to the
                extent that we have already taken actions relying on your authorization.</p>
            <p>You have the following rights with respect to your protected health information, which you can exercise
                by
                presenting a written request to the Company:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have the right to ask for restrictions on the ways we use and disclose your health information
                    for
                    treatment, payment, and healthcare operations. You may also request that we limit our disclosures to
                    persons assisting your care. We will consider your request, but are not required to accept it.</li>
                <li>You have the right to request that you receive communications containing your protected health
                    information from us by alternative means or at alternative locations. For example, you may ask that
                    we
                    only contact you at home or by mail.</li>
                <li>Except under certain circumstances, you have the right to inspect and copy medical, billing and
                    other
                    records used to make decisions about you. If you ask for copies of this information, we may charge
                    you a
                    nominal fee for copying, packaging, and postage.</li>
                <li>If you believe that information in your records is incorrect, or incomplete, you have the right to
                    ask
                    us to correct the existing information, or add missing information. Under certain circumstances, we
                    may
                    deny your request, such as when the information is accurate and complete.</li>
                <li>You have a right to receive a list of certain instances when we have used or disclosed your medical
                    information. If you ask for this information from us more than once every twelve months, charges may
                    apply, to cover our costs for administration, archive retrieval, copying, packaging, and postage.
